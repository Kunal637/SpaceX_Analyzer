ðŸš€ SpaceX Launch Analysis & Prediction Platform

Welcome to the SpaceX Launch Analysis & Prediction Platform, a powerful Streamlit web application that visualizes SpaceX launch data, uncovers insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predicts launch success using machine learning. Enhanced with weather data, this platform provides a comprehensive tool for space enthusiasts, data scientists, and analysts to explore historical launches and forecast future outcomes.


Interactive dashboard showcasing launch trends and predictions.

ðŸŒŸ Features





Interactive Visualizations: Explore launch success rates, payload mass distributions, rocket types, and weather impacts through dynamic charts.



Geospatial Mapping: Visualize launch sites on an interactive map with success/failure markers.



Machine Learning Predictions: Predict launch success with a Random Forest model, incorporating factors like payload mass, rocket type, and weather conditions.



Weather Integration: Analyze the influence of weather (e.g., "Light rain", "Clear"), temperature, and wind speed on launch outcomes.



User-Friendly Interface: Filter data by year, rocket type, launch site, and weather condition for tailored insights.



Robust Data Handling: Processes a local CSV dataset with SpaceX launch and weather data, ensuring reliability and valid payload masses.
